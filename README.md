Peace be upon you
How are you, heroes? I hope you’re all doing great 💙

This time, the assignment won’t just make us apply what we learned in the lectures. No, it will also include a lot of bonus parts for practicing search skills (and based on that, we’ll see who’s the best in the group 😎😎).

The task is to build a website exactly like this one, and it must be 100% responsive:

Before starting the assignment, there are a few topics you should have studied, and some small things you’ll need to research. You’ll find them in this PDF:

Let me give you some hints to help you ☺:

🔴 Navbar:
✅ When the page opens, Home should be active (underlined and styled differently). If you click any other link, that link should become active. (Here you’ll need to search about :has and :target as mentioned in the PDF above 👆).
✅ Don’t forget to add dark mode in the navbar. (You’ll need to search about :checked).

🔴 Header:
✅ Add a shadow around the image (search about the drop-shadow filter).

🔴 Gallery:
✅ Recreate it exactly as it is (search about masonry layout).

⚠⚠ In general, searching starts when you don’t even know what to search for 😅. You’ll go here and there until you reach the solution. Trust me, the information you gather along the way is exactly what makes you a really strong front-end developer 💙.

And don’t worry — all the things you need to research will be included later with the solution of the assignment on the drive 😉💙

👉 Dark mode is optional but will give you a bonus point.

Deadline: Saturday at 10 PM
